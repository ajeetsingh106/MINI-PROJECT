 Tic tac toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

# Rules of the Game

* The game is to be played between two people.
* One of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells.
* The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’).
* If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.
